The program will be run by the Students’ Gymkhana with the support from AA board members Ms. Apoorva Khandelwal and Ms. Smita Hashim. It seeks to enhance the career awareness of the mentees so that they are better equipped to find off-campus applications, go for MBA/MS/Ph.D., and/or jobs that match their goals and interests."},
